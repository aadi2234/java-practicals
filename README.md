### ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of practical programs covering fundamental and advanced concepts of Core Java.

---

### ðŸ“š Concepts Covered
The practicals are organized by topic, covering the entire spectrum of Core Java.

Java Fundamentals
  - Basic Syntax: "Hello, World!", understanding the main method.
  - Data Types, Variables & Literals: Primitive types (int, char, double, boolean) and reference types.
  - Operators: Arithmetic, Relational, Logical, Bitwise, and Ternary operators.
  - Control Flow:
    - Conditional Statements: if, if-else, nested if-else, switch-case.
    - Looping Statements: for, while, do-while, enhanced for loop.
    - Jumping Statements: break, continue, return.
  - Arrays: Single-dimensional, multi-dimensional, and jagged arrays.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)
  - Classes and Objects: The fundamental building blocks of OOP.
  - Constructors: Default, parameterized, and copy constructors; constructor overloading. 
  - this and static Keywords: Understanding their usage and purpose.

The Four Pillars of OOP:
  - Inheritance: extends keyword, types of inheritance (Single, Multilevel, Hierarchical).
  - Polymorphism: Method Overloading (Compile-time) and Method Overriding (Run-time).
  - Abstraction: Abstract classes and interfaces.
  - Encapsulation: Using access modifiers (public, private, protected, default) to bundle data and methods.

Packages: Creating and using user-defined packages to organize classes.
